This app is designed to compile and organize forum posts from GGG’s Standard Trading Shops that are up for Mirror Service or are part of a Mirror Shop. It specifically targets threads with “mirror shop” or “mirror service” in their titles. Each profile can have one mirror thread indexed at a time, specifically the highest indexed thread in the 50 pages. However, the app currently does not support jewels due to their different item format.

The app also provides a search functionality where users can add keyword filters. These filters can match shop titles (Title filters), an item’s quality, base, or name (Base filters), or any item mod (Mod filters).
